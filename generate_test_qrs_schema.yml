# Contains all of the variables in the schema/match_collection_qr_schema.yml file
# Each variable has attributes that determine how it is randomly generated

# gen: if True, this variable can be randomly generated, such as amount of pieces scored.
#      if False, variable has to be manually added to the QR, such as match numbers

# symbol: the compressed name of the variable. See schema/match_collection_qr_schema.yml for more information.

# type: the data type of the variable, such as int, str, or bool.

# is_random: if True the variable does not depend on team skill level, and the variable is randomly generated between a min and max value.
#            if False, the variable is generated based on team skill level, and the list of values is ordered from least skill to most skill.

# values: the list of possible values the variable can be.
#         if the type is an int, the list will contain the min and max value
#          if the type is a str, the list will contain a list of all possible values.
