# Used for Match Collection QR compression by Match Collection App and QR decompression by Server
# QR is encoded in an Alphanumeric QR

# Contains information about this schema file
schema_file:
  # Version of schema file
  # Incremented every merged schema change
  version: 1

# Each decompressed variable name corresponds to a length 2 or 3 list
# First item is the compressed variable name
# Second item is server-side data type
# Third item (if it exists) is the type within the list, if a dict it requires specific implementation in decompressor
# Fourth item (if it exists) is the length of each item in a none-dict list, if not provided _list_data_separator is used as a separator
# Names starting with "_" do not correspond to a compressed variable, they are used to aid in (de)compression
_list_data_separator: "&"
# Data that is shared between the objective and subjective QRs.
